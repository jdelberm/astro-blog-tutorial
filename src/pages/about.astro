        <h2>Why Astro?</h2>
        <p>
            Because I wanted to try the framework and evaluate the affinity it
            could have with my side-projects
        </p>
        <h2>Why Netlify?</h2>
        <p>
            I have never used Netlify until I found the official Astro tutorial,
            so in order to get the most out of it, I am following it step by
            step without leaving anything untied
        </p>
        <h2>A little about myself</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
            <li>
                I am from {identity.country} and I work as a {
                    identity.occupation
                }
            </li>
            {
                identity.hobbies.length >= 2 && (
                    <li>
                        Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and{" "}

                    </li>
